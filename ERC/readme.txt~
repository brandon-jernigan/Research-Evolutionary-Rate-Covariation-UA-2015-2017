ERC_concise.R is the script which calculates the ERC values from a list of phylogenetic trees with branch lengths

yeast_load_erc_output.py this script prepares two ERC tables for comparison in  was used to compare tables of ERC values (compare to Nathan Clarks ERC values online)

plot_yeast_erc_old_and_new.R was used to compare tables of ERC values (compare to Nathan Clarks ERC values online)

yeast_domain_erc_values.tsv ERC for yeast domains

yeast_domain_erc_pvalues.tsv p values for ERC for yeast domains

yeast_protein_erc_values.tsv ERC for yeast proteins

yeast_tree_file_brians_domains.txt tree list using Brian's domain annotations

yeast_tree_file_domains.txt tree list with yeast domains

yeast_tree_file_proteins tree list with yeast proteins

yeast_tree_file_windows_brians.txt tree list of brians sequences cut into 25 amino acid windows
